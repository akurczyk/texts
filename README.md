# texts
Unfinished Django project that I have started a while ago when I was learning Django. It is a website similar to 9gag but for pasting texts that are converted to images with imgkit and Celery libraries. The GUI is based on Bootstrap.

List of the things that has to be done:
1. Sidebar
2. Comments
3. Comments pagination
4. User profile view
5. Edit user profile view
